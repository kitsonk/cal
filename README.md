# cal
## Client API Layer

A prototype client API abstraction layer.

## Installation

First you need to have Node.JS installed including `npm`.  Then you need to install LoopBack:

```bash
$ npm install -g strongloop
```

Then you need to clone the repository:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/kitsonk/cal.git
```

Then, navigate to the path and start:

```bash
$ cd cal
$ slc start
```

It should then be running on `localhost:3000`.  If you navigate to a `http://localhost:3000/catalogue/`
you will get a proxied version of the content catalogue.

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).
